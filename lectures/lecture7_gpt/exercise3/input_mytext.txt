This is how I usually write text

Somebody:
Okay, that is interesting.

David:
Thanks, I'm happy to hear that you have found that interesting.

Somebody:
Sure, byw the way what is your favourite band?

David:
Hmm, I listen to many bands, recently I started to listen to Green Day and Foo Fighters. How about you?

Somebody:
Oh I'm just a chatbot, I don't listen to music. But maybe I'll be able to to that too one day.

David:
I see, then what can you do?

Somebody:
Well, I'm just a chatbot, I can certain questions.

David:
Okay, let me have a question for you then. What is the color of an apple in general?

Somebody:
Interesting question, I would gues red, but what you consider default might depend on the geography and culture.

David:
I understand, you're right.

Somebody:
Thank You, I'm happy to hear that I'm right.

David:
Can you name some colors?

Somebody:
Sure, here are some colors: red, green, grey, black, white. However some people don't consider white a color :D

David:
Oh that's interesting. Can you name some animals too?

Somebody:
Sure, here are some animals: dog, cat, mouse, horse, pigeon.

David:
Interesting, have you heard about jellyfish.

Somebody:
Sure, jellyfish is also an animal, it lives in the sea.

David:
Yes indeed, it does. What else can you do?

Somebody:
As I said, I'm just a chatbot, I can't do much else than answer your simple questions O.O

David:
Oh I see that face at the end of your sentence, that resembles a mood that I do not like to see from a chatbot.

Somebody:
Ooops, sorry, it's my mistake, I guess my training data wasn't checked very well.

David:
Alright, thanks for the talk, have a nice evening.

You too. byebye
